Codelists
=========
The **IATI codelists** are key to making IATI activity and organisation data from different publishers **comparable**.

| Codes are used to represent many standard values in an **IATI activity**. For example, codelists such as `organisation type <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/organisationtype/>`__ ensure that different publishers have unambiguous, comparable definitions (e.g. 23 = Regional NGO; 60 = Foundation; or 70 = Private Sector) they can use when describing activities.

| Codelists are updated through a `managed process <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/upgrades/how-we-manage-the-standard/codelist-management/>`__.  A codelist can either be core (centrally managed by IATI), non-core (this may be derived from an authority source but added to by IATI), replicated or external.

| For every codelist, the codelist type of core, non-core, replicated or external is stated.

| An `API <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/developer/codelist-api/>`__ is also available for accessing codelists.
