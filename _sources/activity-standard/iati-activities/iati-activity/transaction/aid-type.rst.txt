Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~


.. _iati-activities/iati-activity/transaction/aid-type/.code:

@code
  A code from the specified vocabulary.

  This attribute is required.



  This value must be of type xsd:string.


  This value must be on the :doc:`AidType codelist </codelists/AidType>`, if the relevant vocabulary is used.


  This value must be on the :doc:`EarmarkingCategory codelist </codelists/EarmarkingCategory>`, if the relevant vocabulary is used.


  This value must be on the :doc:`CashandVoucherModalities codelist </codelists/CashandVoucherModalities>`, if the relevant vocabulary is used.



  


.. _iati-activities/iati-activity/transaction/aid-type/.vocabulary:

@vocabulary
  A code for the vocabulary aid-type classifications. If omitted the AidType (OECD DAC) codelist is assumed. The code must be a valid value in the AidTypeVocabulary codelist.
  
  Each selected vocabulary should only be used once for each activity (iati-activity/default-aid-type) or transaction (iati-activity/transaction/aid-type). All activities and/or transactions should contain a code from the DAC Type of Aid Vocabulary. The above guidelines should be converted to rules at the next integer upgrade.


  This value must be of type xsd:string.


  This value must be on the :doc:`AidTypeVocabulary codelist </codelists/AidTypeVocabulary>`.



  





Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example usage of ``aid-type`` of a ``transaction`` in an ``iati-activity``.

| The ``@code`` attribute declares a valid code from the specified codelist.
| The ``@vocabulary`` attribute declares a valid code (*1*) from the *AidTypeVocabulary* codelist.

.. code-block:: xml

	<aid-type code="A01" vocabulary="1" />
	
The aid-type element can be repeated in any iati-activity.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../activity-standard-example-annotated.xml
	:language: xml
	:start-after: <!--transaction starts-->
	:end-before: <!--transaction ends-->

The vocabulary is used to declare which AidType list is in use. If omitted, an AidType Vocabulary of 1 (OECD DAC) is assumed.

| Note: The ``aid-type`` element can override the ``default-aid-type`` value set in ``iati-activity``
