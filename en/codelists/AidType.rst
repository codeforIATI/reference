   * - A01   
       
     - General budget support
     - Unearmarked contributions to the government budget including funding to support the implementation of macroeconomic reforms (structural adjustment programmes, poverty reduction strategies). Budget support is a method of financing a recipient country’s budget through a transfer of resources from an external financing agency to the recipient government’s national treasury. The funds thus transferred are managed in accordance with the recipient’s budgetary procedures. Funds transferred to the national treasury for financing programmes or projects managed according to different budgetary procedures from those of the recipient country, with the intention of earmarking the resources for specific uses, are therefore excluded.
     - :ref:`A <AidType-category>`
   
       
   * - A02   
       
     - Sector budget support
     - Sector budget support, like general budget support, is a financial contribution to a recipient government’s budget. However, in sector budget support, the dialogue between donors and partner governments focuses on sector-specific concerns, rather than on overall policy and budget priorities.
     - :ref:`A <AidType-category>`
   
       
   * - B01   
       
     - Core support to NGOs, other private bodies, PPPs and research institutes
     - Funds are paid over to NGOs (local, national and international) for use at the latter’s discretion, and contribute to programmes and activities which NGOs have developed themselves, and which they implement on their own authority and responsibility. Core contributions to PPPs, funds paid over to foundations (e.g. philanthropic foundations), and contributions to research institutes (public and private) are also recorded here. Annex 2 of the DAC Directives provides a list of INGOs, PPPs and networks core contributions to which may be reported under B01. This list is not exclusive.
     - :ref:`B <AidType-category>`
   
       
   * - B02   
       
     - Core contributions to multilateral institutions
     - These funds are classified as multilateral ODA (all other categories fall under bilateral ODA). The recipient multilateral institution pools contributions so that they lose their identity and become an integral part of its financial assets. See Annex 2 of the DAC Directives for a comprehensive list of agencies core contributions to which may be reported under B02 (Section I. Multilateral institutions).
     - :ref:`B <AidType-category>`
   
       
   * - B03   
       
     - Contributions to specific-purpose programmes and funds managed by implementing partners
     - In addition to their core-funded operations, international organisations, NGOs, PPPs and networks, both in provider and in third countries, set up programmes and funds with a specific sectoral, thematic or geographical focus. Donors’ bilateral contributions to such programmes and funds are recorded here.
     - :ref:`B <AidType-category>`
   
       
   * - B031   
       
     - Contributions to multi-donor/multi-entity funding mechanisms
     - Funding mechanisms that pool contributions from several donors and that are implemented by several multilateral entities e.g. UN inter-agency pooled funds, including CERF and country-based pooled funds; Financial Intermediary Funds (GEF, CIFs) for which the World Bank is the Trustee.
     - :ref:`B03 <AidType-category>`
   
       
   * - B032   
       
     - Contributions to multi-donor/single-entity funding mechanisms
     - Contributions to multi-donor funding mechanisms managed by a single multilateral organisation e.g. UN single-agency thematic funds; World Bank or other MDB trust funds. Classify the contribution as B032 even if in the initial stages only one donor contributes to the fund.
     - :ref:`B03 <AidType-category>`
   
       
   * - B033   
       
     - Contributions to single-donor funding mechanisms and contributions earmarked for a specific funding window or geographical location
     - Contributions to funding mechanisms where the donor has a significant influence on the allocation of funds. This includes contributions to single-donor trust funds and earmarked contributions to specific countries/geographical locations or funding windows within multi-donor trust funds. When the donor designs the activity but channels it through an international organisation, the activity should be classified as C01.
     - :ref:`B03 <AidType-category>`
   
       
   * - B04   
       
     - Basket funds/pooled funding
     - The donor contributes funds to an autonomous account, managed jointly with other donors and/or the recipient. The account will have specific purposes, modes of disbursement and accountability mechanisms, and a limited time frame. Basket funds are characterised by common project documents, common funding contracts and common reporting/audit procedures with all donors. Donors’ contributions to funds managed autonomously by international organisations are recorded under B03.
     - :ref:`B <AidType-category>`
   
       
   * - C01   
       
     - Project-type interventions
     - A project is a set of inputs, activities and outputs, agreed with the partner country*, to reach specific objectives/outcomes within a defined time frame, with a defined budget and a defined geographical area. Projects can vary significantly in terms of objectives, complexity, amounts involved and duration. There are smaller projects that might involve modest financial resources and last only a few months, whereas large projects might involve more significant amounts, entail successive phases and last for many years. A large project with a number of different components is sometimes referred to as a programme, but should nevertheless be recorded here. Feasibility studies, appraisals and evaluations are included (whether designed as part of projects/programmes or dedicated funding arrangements). Academic studies, research and development, trainings, scholarships, and other technical assistance activities not directly linked to development projects/programmes should instead be recorded under D02. Aid channelled through NGOs or multilaterals is also recorded here. This includes payments for NGOs and multilaterals to implement donors’ projects and programmes, and funding of specified NGOs projects. By contrast, core funding of NGOs and multilaterals as well as contributions to specific-purpose funds are recorded under B.* In the cases of equity investments, humanitarian aid or aid channelled through NGOs, projects are recorded here even if there was no direct agreement between the donor and the partner country. Contributions to single-donor trust funds and contributions to trust funds earmarked for a specific funding window and/or country are recorded under B033.

   * - H02   
       
     - Refugees/asylum seekers in donor countries
     - Costs incurred in donor countries for basic assistance to asylum seekers and refugees from developing countries, up to 12 months, when costs cannot be disaggregated. See section II.6 and Annex 17.

     - Asylum-seekers ultimately rejected
     - Costs incurred in donor countries for basic assistance to asylum seekers, when these are ultimately rejected. This category includes only costs incurred prior to rejection. Members may base their reporting on the first instance rejection, where a final decision on status is anticipated to occur after a 12-month period, and this facilitates the establishment of a conservative estimate. For further guidance on how to proceed with calculating costs related to rejected asylum seekers, see Clarification 5, third bullet in section II.6 of the Reporting Directives.
